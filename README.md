<h1>Welcom to MindusTrinity<h1>

<h2>A little addon with 3 new element. This mod add turrets, new units and lots of vanilla improvement.<h2>

<h2>This is not a full release and might be bugged, unbalanced or not textured so keep it up to date.<h2>

<h2>If you are reading this you might be interested in my mod so here is the addon link of my mod that will unlock beta content for you :P<h2>

<h2>Warning !

I Personally use other mod sprites, but TEMPORARILY I will change them when the mod will be in full release (just the time i make my own).

If you don't want to see your sprites in my mod (even temporary), ask me and i will remove them. No offences.<h2>
